# Comment classification of C code
This project is a submission of subtask named Information Retreival in Software Engineering [(IRSE)](https://sites.google.com/view/ir-se/home) given by Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation 2022. It aims to present different text mining frameworks and analyze their performance for classification of C codes as useful or non-useful.
The techniques involve various classifiers and feature engineering schemes. The simple bag of words model has been used to build features from free text. Subsequently, ada boost, random forest, logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are used to identify self-harm from the given texts. 
## Pre-requisites
 NLTK, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Torch, Transformers
## To run the framework
